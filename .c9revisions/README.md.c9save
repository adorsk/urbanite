By aggregating those feeds by category and sub-category, we can let people explore cultural events in their neighborhoods. \r\n\r\nOriginally written by the fuzzy-narwhal team at the Boston Civic Hack Day Challenge (Including Mark Chang, Rachael Stedman, Harlan Weber, Nick Hays, Chris Marstall, and others) the app was originally written in Rails and used a scraper to access the FB feeds of a curated list of culturemakers in Boston. In the future, we would like to explore on-site modes of use, mobile web or native mobile implementations, and a way for new venues and cultural groups to make their way on to the list without explicit moderation.\r\n\r\nOriginal repo can be found here https://github.com/fuzzy-narwhal\r\n\r\nCfA Collaboration Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13J4-kye8bq-Cr-rbusUTN-sNSMfPnfD8jvCw0Zi3wm4/edit?usp=sharing\r\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":1029,"length2":1339}]],"length":1339,"saved":false}
