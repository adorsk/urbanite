Urbanite: Boston is an app that allows users to access 'hidden' cultural gems in their local environment by leveraging social media streams from local venues and cultural organizations like bands, artists, authors, chefs, etc. It's based on the idea that most major media outlets don't necessarily know or report on what bands are playing at the Middle East or what movies are at the Brattle, but those places are promoting their lineups on their own Facebook and Twitter feeds. By aggregating those feeds by category and sub-category, we can let people explore cultural events in their neighborhoods. 

Originally written by the fuzzy-narwhal team at the Boston Civic Hack Day Challenge (Including Mark Chang, Rachael Stedman, Harlan Weber, Nick Hays, Chris Marstall, and others) the app was originally written in Rails and used a scraper to access the FB feeds of a curated list of culturemakers in Boston. In the future, we would like to explore on-site modes of use, mobile web or native mobile implementations, and a way for new venues and cultural groups to make their way on to the list without explicit moderation.
